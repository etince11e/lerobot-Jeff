Pico4 Ultra independent motion-tracker reader.

This is a *thin* reader, not a full Teleoperator. It reads one motion
tracker from the XenseVR PC Service and emits the same 9-D pose dict
(``tcp.x/y/z`` + ``tcp.r1-r6`` in 6D rotation representation) that
``ViveTrackerTeleop.get_action()`` produces — so a robot can swap a Vive
reader for a Pico4 reader without changing its observation schema.

The XenseVR service exposes up to three independent trackers. We pin to
one tracker by serial number; if no SN is given we take whichever one
the service reports at index 0.

Coordinate frame
----------------
The tracker pose this reader emits is in the **same xrt-native frame
as the controller poses** that ``teleop_pico4.get_*_controller_pose()``
returns — both come from the same XenseVR PC Service via the same
pybind, just different endpoint calls (``get_motion_tracker_pose`` vs.
``get_left/right_controller_pose``). So if you want this reader to act
as a drop-in replacement for the controller in a teleop flow, apply
the same coordinate transform that the controller-based teleop applies
(e.g. ``teleop_pico4`` does a Pico→world remap in
``_transform_pico_to_world_coordinate``; you'd reuse that on top of ``get_pose_raw()``).

For handheld data collection there is no arm to align to, so we don't
remap — we emit the raw xrt frame and leave reframing to post-processing.

The world origin is the headset position the moment the Unity VR app
started — *not* when xrt.init() ran, *not* when you clicked Connect in
Unity. Restarting Unity mid-session relocates the origin.

The axis convention (handedness, Z direction) is documented inconsistently
upstream — Pico docs say right-handed, SDK example notes left-handed.
Treat this as **TBD pending live verification on real hardware**. The
reader returns what xrt gives us, untouched apart from the configurable
rigid mount transform (``tracker_to_ee_pos`` / ``tracker_to_ee_quat``).

Concurrency
-----------
``xrt.init()`` is a process-level singleton. This module guards it with
a class-level flag so multiple readers in one process share the same
SDK instance. ``xrt.close()`` is intentionally NOT called on disconnect
— if a second subscriber is still alive, closing tears it down too.
Rely on process exit.

Threading model — background poller
-----------------------------------
A daemon thread polls ``xrt.get_motion_tracker_pose()`` at the Pico
tracker's native rate (~90 Hz) and caches the latest pose under a
lock. ``get_pose_raw()`` / ``get_pose_ee()`` / ``get_action()`` read
from this cache, never block the SDK. Benefits:

  * A hung PC Service cannot stall the observation thread.
  * The tracker runs at its native rate regardless of how slowly the
    consumer polls (slower → simply gets the freshest sample).
  * Hemisphere-continuity fix is applied in-thread sequentially, so
    even very slow consumers see a continuous quaternion stream.

Matches the architecture of the SDK's
``examples/rerun_dual_with_tracker.py`` ``TrackerPoller``.
